# BitShifter

BitShifter is a small bit-manipulation game written in C using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

This is my very first C project!  
I made it to learn C programming, basic game loops, and how to use the Raylib graphics library.

## How to Play

- Use the number keys `1-8` to flip each bit.
- The goal is to match a target value within the time limit (30 seconds).
- Press `P` to pause/unpause the game.

## Building and Running
